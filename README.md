# Lucid Dream Game
This is the game project developed for my final bachelor's thesis "Implementation of a lucid dream game" (http://campar.in.tum.de/Students/DaTraum). 
The goal was to research lucid dreams, how to induce them and how they are represented. The results were implemented  in a game using the Unity3D in C# game engine.
